# myfind

A command line tool similar to `find` to parallely find different files in a folder.

## Usage

`./myfind [-R] [-i] searchpath filename1 [filename2] ...[filenameN]`

The main program accepts the arguments <searchpath> and <filename1 .. N>. Keep in mind that a
variable number of arguments (= variable number of filenames to look for) can be used and that the
options -R and -i can be placed anywhere in the arguments list.

* -R:
  * should switch myfind in recursive mode and find all matching files in and below the
  searchpath folder
  (else the files should only be searched in the searchpath folder)

* -i 
  * case in-sensitive search 

* searchpath
  * can be an absolute or a relative path.

* filename
  * only filenames as plain string
  * no support for paths, subpaths, wildcards required.
